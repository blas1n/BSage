"""Tests for MergeConcepts action (Handoff §7.2).

Validates the four key effects:
- Update canonical aliases (alias_policy)
- Create tombstones at concepts/merged/<old-id>.md (tombstone_policy)
- Retag garden notes from merged ids to canonical (retag_policy)
- Hard Blocks: invalid params, non-active targets, self-merge, redirect cycle
