"""CanonicalizationIndexSubscriber — keeps the canon index fresh from events.

Per Class_Diagram §10.2 — mirrors the existing
``bsage.garden.index_subscriber.IndexSubscriber`` pattern. Subscribes to
the EventBus and calls ``CanonicalizationIndex.invalidate(path)`` on
every event that touches a canon path.

Sources of truth:
- ``CANONICALIZATION_*`` events emitted by the service after every
  successful state transition (Handoff §14)
- ``NOTE_UPDATED`` events from the ``canon-watcher`` plugin (slice 6)
  when external tools (Obsidian, git) edit canon notes outside the API

Defense in depth: the service ALSO calls ``invalidate()`` directly after
each write, so the subscriber's job is mostly to catch external writes.
Re-invalidating an already-fresh path is a no-op (idempotent reload).
