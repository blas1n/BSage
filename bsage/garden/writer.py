"""GardenWriter — backwards-compat re-export shim.

The original ~900-line module was split into focused submodules
(:mod:`bsage.garden.note`, :mod:`bsage.garden.writer_tools`,
:mod:`bsage.garden.writer_core`) during Hardening Sprint 2 (M15). This file
preserves the historical public surface so existing call sites such as ::

    from bsage.garden.writer import (
        GardenNote,
        GardenWriter,
        WRITE_NOTE_TOOL,
        ...,
    )

continue to work without modification. New code should prefer importing from
the focused submodules directly.
